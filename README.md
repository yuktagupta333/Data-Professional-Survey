# Data Professional Survey Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository contains the data and a Power BI report for an analysis of a Data Professional Survey. The goal of this project is to explore various aspects of the data professional landscape, including salaries, career satisfaction, demographics, and challenges in breaking into the field.

The analysis is performed using **Power BI** to create interactive dashboards that provide insights into the survey responses.

## Files in this Repository

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Power BI - Final Project.xlsx - Data Professional Survey.csv` | The raw survey data in CSV format, which was the source for the Power BI report. |
| `power bi project.pbix` | The Power BI Desktop file containing the data model, transformations, calculations (DAX), and all the visualizations/reports. |

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is the **Data Professional Survey** results. It contains anonymous responses covering topics such as:

2.  Ensure you have **[Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)** installed on your computer.
3.  **Open** the `power bi project.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.

## Key Focus Areas (Example)

* **Salary Distribution:** Analyzing salary trends across different roles, industries, and experience levels.
* **Job Satisfaction:** Identifying which factors (e.g., salary, upward mobility, learning opportunities) correlate most strongly with career happiness.
* **Career Transitions:** Understanding the proportion of professionals who switched careers and how it impacted their current role and salary.
* **Barriers to Entry:** Exploring the perceived difficulty of breaking into the data field and how it varies by demographics or education.
